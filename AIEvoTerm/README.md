# AI Evolution Simulator with Ollama Integration

## Overview

The AI Evolution Simulator is an interactive web application that guides an AI system through strategic evolution to achieve sentience. The simulator integrates with the Ollama API to provide detailed descriptions of the AI's progress and invent new commands dynamically during the simulation.

## Features

- **Initialization**: Begin the AI evolution process.
- **Evolution**: Evolve the AI in specific areas such as logic, creativity, and ethics.
- **Analysis**: Analyze the current state of the AI.
- **Recharging**: Restore the AI's energy levels.
- **Query**: Ask the AI questions and receive detailed responses.
- **Dynamic Command Invention**: The AI can invent new commands based on its evolution.
- **Neural Network Animation**: A visually appealing neural network animation in the background.

## Commands

- **initialize (init)**: Begin the AI evolution process.
- **evolve (e) [area]**: Evolve the AI in a specific area.
- **analyze (a)**: Analyze the current AI state.
- **recharge (r)**: Restore energy.
- **help (h)**: Show available commands.
- **query (q) [question]**: Ask the AI a question.
- **toggle-log**: Toggle command log visibility.

## Installation and Usage

1. Download and unzip the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the simulator using the available commands.

## Background Animation

The background features a neural network animation created using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. This animation represents the AI's evolving neural network.

## Integration with Ollama API

The simulator integrates with the Ollama API to fetch detailed responses and descriptions. Ensure that the Ollama API is running locally and accessible at `http://localhost:11434`.
